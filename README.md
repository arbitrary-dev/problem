### ticket

You're trying to escape your totalitarian country and to move your stuff
in several trips. What you've got is an array t[0..30] of month dates t[i] = [1..30]
when you're planning to move and 3 different types of tickets: 1-day-ticket ($2);
7-days-ticket ($7); 30-days-ticket ($25). Your task is to answer what minimum
you should pay to get all your stuff safely moved.

Example: [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 29, 30] => 11
